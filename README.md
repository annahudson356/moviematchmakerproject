# Movie Matchmaker!

Have you ever been sitting in your living room with freshly popped popcorn, only to realize you aren't sure what movie to watch? Movie Matchmaker is here to match you with YOUR ideal movie. Just enter a few of your favorite movies, actors, etc and we will determine which movies are the best fit for you!

In order to implement this, we used both the Graph and Heap data structures. We devised algorithms that utilized these data structures to determine a "similarity score" which was used to determine which movie is the most similar to the preferences entered by the user. After these algorithms run their course, the program will return the number of movies that the user requests to be generated!
